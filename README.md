# 🪜 Climbing Stairs

Python solution for the Climbing Stairs dynamic programming problem — count distinct ways to reach the top.

## 🎯 Problem

You are climbing a staircase with `n` steps. Each time you can climb 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways can you reach the top?

## 💡 Approach

- **Dynamic Programming** — O(n) time, O(1) space (Fibonacci-like pattern)
- - **State Transition**: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`
 
  - ## 🛠️ Tech Stack
 
  - - **Language**: Python
    - - **Category**: Dynamic Programming
      - - **Difficulty**: Easy (LeetCode #70)
